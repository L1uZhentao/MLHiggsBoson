# The Magic of Feature Engineering: Higgs Boson Detection using Simple Models

This is EPFL course project Higgs Boson Detection using Machine Learning. 

We investigate a series of models on the Higgs Boson detection task. By combining multiple feature engineering methods, including customized outlier clipping,
cross terms generation, and principle component analysis, we are able to drastically improve the performance of the models applied to this task, reaching an accuracy of 83.7%.
